  "lyrics": "You were from the North, I was from the South\nWe were from opposite places, different towns\nBut I knew it was good and you knew it was too\nSo we moved together like a ball and chain\nMinds becoming two halves of the same\nIt was real, and the shadows grew\n\nCause you've got a secret don't ya babe?\n\nI would've shouted loud and broken through\nI would've given it all to belong to you\nBut there were different plans, different rules\nYou said \"where I'm from there is a lock and key\nIf you'd be so kind as to follow me\nI will show you the way to the rest of my sins\"\n\nCause you've got a secret don't ya babe?\nYeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?\nAnd I should know\nYeah I should know\n\nYeah you, you've got a secret don't ya babe?\nYeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?\nAnd I should know\nYeah I should know\nFor I'm your secret aren't I babe?\nYeah I'm your secret aren't I babe?\nAren't I babe?"
