  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI should have known\nI'd leave alone\nJust goes to show\nThat the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe\nWe were a pair\nBut I saw you there\nToo much to bear\nYou were my life, but life is far away from fair\nWas I stupid to love you?\nWas I reckless to help?\nWas it obvious to everybody else?\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I'd fallen for a lie\nYou were never on my side\nFool me once, fool me twice\nAre you death or paradise?\nNow you'll never see me cry\nThere's just no time to die\n\n[Verse 2]\nI let it burn\nYou're no longer my concern, mmm\nFaces from my past return\nAnother lesson yet to learn\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I'd fallen for a lie\nYou were never on my side\nFool me once, fool me twice\nAre you death or paradise?\nNow you'll never see me cry\nThere's just no time to die\n\n[Refrain]\nNo time to die, mmm\nNo time to die, ooh\n\n[Outro]\nFool me once, fool me twice\nAre you death or paradise?\nNow you'll never see me cry\nThere's just no time to die"
